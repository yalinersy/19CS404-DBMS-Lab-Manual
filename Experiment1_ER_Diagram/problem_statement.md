# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Member | member_id (PK), name, gender, dob, email                    | Represents gym members who register for programs.     |
| Program | program_id (PK), program_name, fee, duration, schedule                   |Represents the different fitness programs (e.g., Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).       |
| Trainers | trainer_id (PK), trainer_name, trainer_gender, trainer_phone, trainer_email, expertise                   | Stores trainer information (e.g., contact details, expertise).      |
| Sessions |session_id (PK), date, time, trainer_id (FK), program_id (FK)                    |Represents individual time-bound classes.       |
| Payment | payment_id (PK), amount, payment_type, payment_date, member_id (FK), program_id (FK)                  | Records payments made by members for specific programs.      |
|Attendance|attendance_id (PK), status, session_id (FK), trainer_id (FK)|Tracks attendance of members in specific sessions.|

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|  enrolls_in           |    M:N        | Member (Total), Program (Partial)              |  A member can enroll in multiple programs; a program can have many members.     |
|   leads           |   1:M         |Program (Total), Trainer (Partial)| Each program is led by one trainer, but a trainer may lead multiple programs.      |
|   registers           |  M:N          |  Both Partial             | A member can register for many sessions, and each session can have many members.      |
|   includes           |  1:M          |   Program (Total), Session (Total)            | A program includes multiple sessions, but each session belongs to only one program.      |
|   has           | 1:M           | Program (Total), Payment (Total)              |A program can have many payments; each payment belongs to one program.       |
|tracks|1:M|Payment (Total), Session (Partial)|Payments are linked to sessions attended by members.|

### Assumptions
- A member must enroll in at least one program.
- A program must be led by at least one trainer.
- Payments are tied to members and programs (not to trainers directly).

# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

| Book       | book_id (PK), title, author, category, duedate                   | Represents books in the library.      |
|Overdue_Fine        | fine_id (PK), amount, member_id (FK)                   | Stores fines for books that were returned late.      |
|  Event      | event_id (PK), event_name, date, time                   | Represents library-organized events (workshops, talks, seminars).      |
| Speaker       |  speaker_id (PK), name, expertise                  | Represents external or internal experts invited for events.      |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|  borrows            |  M:N          | Both Total              | A member can borrow many books, and each book can be borrowed by many members (over time).      |
|   pays           |  1:M          |  Member (Partial), Fine (Total)             | A member may pay many fines; each fine belongs to one member.      |
|   loans           |   1:M         |  Book (Partial), Fine (Total)             | A book may be linked to fines when overdue.      |
| has             |      M:N      |      Both Total         | A book can be stored in multiple rooms, and a room can store multiple books.      |

### Assumptions
- A member must exist before borrowing books or registering for events.
- A book may or may not be borrowed; not all books will always have loans.
- Fines are only generated if a book is returned late.
